 Sure, here's a simple description of your project:

 "Twitter Sentiment Analysis", is like a mood detector for Twitter. I use Python and library called NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to help understand the language in the tweets. It's like a translator that helps your code understand human language.

Then, I use a method called Logistic Regression to make predictions. It's like a magic 8-ball that can predict if a tweet is positive or negative based on the words in it.

So, in short, my project reads tweets, understands them using NLTK, and predicts their mood using Logistic Regression. It's a cool way to understand how people are feeling on Twitter! ðŸ˜Š
